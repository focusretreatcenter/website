# Focus Retreat Center website


## Tech

This is a static website generated from markdown content and templates with the [zola](https://getzola.org) static site generator. The templates are marked up with the [tera 
template language](https://tera.netlify.app).


## Filesystem Layout

**templates** has the main HTML stuff. This started as a 1-pager so there was only index.html but as we add varying page types it will grow.

**content** has most page content as markdown files. Nothing here yet but soon we'll have several pages. The directory structure under `content` maps to web URL paths so this will be filling out organically as we add to the site.

**copy** are smaller sections/excerpts of content mostly for populating the home page just to keep them separate from the HTML so editors can change the words without having to deal with HTML.
