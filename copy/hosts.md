Hi! We are Pete Lyons and Christella Kay! We are life partners running this business together. We decided to build our lives with intention and in a way that lets us work for ourselves while helping others. We have a special fondness for Adirondack State Park and are happy to be living here with nature at our doorstep.

Christella is an innovative thinker with a business degree and restaurant experience. She enjoys the company of nerds and is excited to be fostering community and creating a curated ‘focus intensive vibe’ at our facility.

Pete has over 20 years experience in software development, and a deep appreciation for the value of personal development retreats. In his youth Pete spent 6 consecutive summers at an immersive music institute at Hartwick College in Oneonta, NY, a formative and wonderful experience he's delighted to share a flavor of with others.
