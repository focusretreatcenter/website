## The retreat experience

Focus Retreat Center offers a quiet environment to focus on deep, self-directed project work. There are common areas suitable for idea sharing and team work as well as private rooms for solitary work. There are about 15 guests per retreat, usually for 4 weeks. An online community connects you during and after the retreat. Friendships and connections made here can last a lifetime.

We provide room, board, a curated environment, carefully screened peers, and light-touch facilitation. Guests get a level of depth of focus that is exceedingly rare in modern life's hustle and bustle. The retreat center offers a reprieve from the appointments, obligations, chores, routines and distractions of everyday life. We provide a space tailored for personal development and a right-sized group of peers to enrich and support each otherâ€™s experiences and develop life-long friendships.
