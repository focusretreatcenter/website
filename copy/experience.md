## The retreat experience

Focus Retreat Center offers a quiet environment to focus on deep, self-directed project work. There are common areas where idea sharing and team work will be encouraged, as well as private quarters for solitary work. There are about 15 guests per retreat, usually for 4 weeks. An online community connects you during and after the retreat... Friendships and connections made here can last a lifetime.
