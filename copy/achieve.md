Totally immerse in your project, sharing supportive work and living spaces with a select group of peers, away from daily responsibilities - located in beautiful Upstate New York, close to Adirondack Park, the Saint Lawrence River, and Canada.

We offer retreats focused on individual projects that benefit from a community of peers doing similar work and substantial focused time.
                    
We provide room, board, a curated environment, carefully screened peers, and light-touch facilitation. Guests get a level of depth of focus that is exceedingly rare in modern life's hustle and bustle. The retreat center offers a reprieve from the appointments, obligations, chores, routines and distractions of everyday life. We provide a space tailored for personal development and a right-sized group of peers to enrich and support each otherâ€™s experiences and develop life-long friendships.
