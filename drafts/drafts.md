A place for deep work on creative projects

# Overview

Focus Retreat Center provides a curated space for creative people to focus intensely on their work while surrounded by a supportive community of peers doing similar work. Our retreats are a time to step away from the obligations of your normal routine and focus deeply on doing your best work.

# Team

FRC is run by Pete Lyons and Stella Kay.

Pete has been enamored with focused work since adolescence. As a young music student, he opted to spend his summers studying at a music institute run on a college campus every summer from 6th grade on through high school. He continued practicing at the Oberlin Conservatory and then went on to work as a software developer, where this discipline and focus allowed him to keep up with the constant learning demanded of computer programmers. He took several sabatticals in his career to change directions and tackle personal projects. He is excited to bring that opportunity to more people in computer programming and other creative fields.

Stella enjoys the company of nerds and is excited about fostering community and bringing a curated ‘focus intensive vibe’ to the facility. She is a natural caregiver and empath. She runs the kitchen and serves as Director of Operations.
