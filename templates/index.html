  <h2>The Retreat Experience</h2>

  <p>
    Focus Retreat Center offers a quiet environment to focus on deep,
    self-directed project work. There are common areas suitable for idea sharing
    and team work as well as private rooms for solitary work. There are about 14
    guests per retreat, usually for 1 week. An online community connects you
    during and after the retreat. Friendships and connections made here can last
    a lifetime.
  </p>

  <p>
    We provide room, board, a curated environment, carefully screened peers, and
    light-touch facilitation. Guests get a level of depth of focus that is
    exceedingly rare in modern life's hustle and bustle. The retreat center
    offers a reprieve from the appointments, obligations, chores, routines and
    distractions of everyday life. We provide a space tailored for personal
    development and a right-sized group of peers to enrich and support each
    other’s experiences and develop life-long friendships.

    <h2>About Your Hosts</h2>

    <p>
      Hi! We are Christella Kay and Pete Lyons! We are life partners running
      this business together. We decided to build our lives with intention and
      in a way that lets us work for ourselves while helping others. We have a
      special fondness for Adirondack Park and are happy to be living here with
      nature at our doorstep.
    </p>

    <p>
      Christella is an innovative thinker with a business degree and restaurant
      experience. She enjoys being around enthusiastic geeks and is excited to
      be fostering community and creating a curated ‘focus intensive vibe’ at
      our facility.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pete has over 20 years experience in software development, and a deep
      appreciation for the value of personal development retreats. In his youth
      Pete spent 6 consecutive summers at an immersive music institute at
      Hartwick College in Oneonta, NY - a formative and wonderful experience
      he's delighted to share a flavor of with others.

    <h2>About Our Center</h2>
    <p>
      Our retreat center is located in the heart of the Village of Malone. All
      modern amenities are nearby such as convenience stores, pharmacies, a
      Walmart, etc. But we are also adjacent to Adirondack Park and thousands of
      lakes, rivers, mountains, and hiking trails just a short drive to the
      south. We sit directly facing a lovely small park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our facility is two connected buildings. The fieldstone farmhouse building
      to the rear dates circa 1891 and serves as our dining room and kitchen.
      The large brick building to the front dates from the 1930s and was
      originally constructed as a school building. The property has been through
      several uses and renovations during more than a century of service. We are
      located in a NY state historic district and the residential neighborhood
      around us includes many lovely examples of Victorian era homes.
