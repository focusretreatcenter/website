+++

This is an immersive project/learning retreat for software developers. You will spend your time on retreat working on a specific project or learning a particular subject. You will be surrounded by a community of supportive peers doing similar work.

For our opening season we are offering flexible retreat schedules so as many people get to experience a retreat this season as possible. Retreats are available on a weekly basis and we recommend at least two weeks so you can realistically advance your project and justify the travel time.

## What is a self-directed programming retreat?

This retreat provides a substantial block of time to work on projects where you are fully in control of your own time. You choose what to work on or what to learn and how to go about it. There are deliberately no formal classes, curricula, teachers, or instruction.

## Summer in the Adirondacks

Adirondack State Park is the largest publicly protected area in the contiguous United States. It constitues 6 million acres of forest, rivers, lakes, mountains, and trails. Summertime here is glorious: warm enough to swim in the fresh water lakes but never uncomfortably hot. Most activities are either free or very low cost.

## Food

All meals are freshly prepared with in-season, locally-sourced ingredients by our in-house chef and Director of Operations Christella Kay. Coffee, tea, soft drinks and snacks are provided. All meals, snacks, and non-alcoholic beverages are included in the price of your retreat. Alcohol is not included or provided but guests may purchase and consume alcoholic beverages in accordance with our retreat handbook guidelines.

## Equipment

Each guest will have a sit/stand adjustable desk and ergonomic office chair. Our facility has high-speed (940 Mbps) Internet and WiFi6 access points throughout the property as well as ethernet jacks and power outlets always nearby.

## How do I get there?

**Car:** Malone, NY is drivable in a day from NYC, Boston, or Montreal. If you plan to drive a private car just let us know. We have private off-street parking available for a limited number of guests. If you are willing to offer carpool rides to other guests, that's fantastic. Let us know and we can help coordinate.

**Bus:** Greyhound runs from Port Authority to Plattsburg, NY departing 8:30 AM and arriving at 3:30 PM for $69. We can shuttle groups from Plattsburgh to FRC.

**Train:** Amtrack to Albany will get you about half way to FRC but still 3.5 hours to drive from there. You can also take a bus from Albany to Plattsburgh which is much closer to FRC.

**Plane:** Flying into Albany, NY is your best option. If you can take rideshare/taxi to the Albany Greyhound bus station, you can take the bus on to Plattsburgh, NY and we can coordinate a ride from Plattsburgh to Malone for you.
