## What is a self-directed programming retreat?

This retreat provides a substantial block of time to work on projects where you are fully in control of your own time. You choose what to work on or what to learn and how to go about it. There are deliberately no formal classes, curricula, teachers, or instruction.

## Summer in the Adirondacks

Adirondack State Park is the largest publicly protected area in the contiguous United States. It constitues 6 million acres of forest, rivers, lakes, mountains, and trails. Summertime here is glorious: warm enough to swim in the fresh water lakes but never uncomfortably hot. Most activities are either free or very low cost.

All meals, snacks, and non-alcoholic beverages are included in the price of your retreat.
