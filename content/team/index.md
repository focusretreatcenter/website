        degree from the Oberlin Conservatory of Music. The long hours of
        practice and annual participation in Hartwick College Summer Music
        Festival And Institute gave Pete an appreciation for focused skill
        development work and the upstate New York setting.

      <p>
        Christella has a business degree and a diverse background of employment.
        She is a self-starter and innovative thinker as demonstrated. She has
        been cooking daily for most of her adult life and has restaurant
        experience from a small Italian restaurant called La Paninoteca. While
        at La Pan, Christella learned many Italian kitchen ‘secrets’ from the
        owner. Christella enjoys the company of nerds and is excited about the
        idea of fostering community and bringing a curated ‘focus intensive
        vibe’ to the facility.
