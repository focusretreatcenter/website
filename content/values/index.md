# Retreat as Sabbatical

Meaningful work can’t flourish and thrive when squeezed into the margins of overscheduled busy lives. Our retreats and residencies take inspiration from academic sabbatical to provide an extended but bounded time to do your deepest, most creative work.

In order to create space, we must pause and set aside our normal lifestyle. Guests at FRC a given a rest from…

(TODO: image of stress/busyness here)

* child, family, and pet care
* chores and errands
* commuting and traffic
* social obligations, events, and hobbies
* cooking, grocery shopping, and meal planning
* washing dishes
* the decision fatigue of complex life

# Intrinsic Motivation

A creator's innate motivation is the most powerful force. We value this above external forces like top-down curricula, cookie-cutter courses, micromanagement, and achievement based on comparison to others.

* Make what you are inspired to make
* Learn what is interesting to you
* Work on projects that are meaningful and important to you
* Do the work you choose on a schedule that is healthy for you

# Focused Work

We value deep work and believe it should be provided with ample time and focus so it can fully flourish. We believe in single-tasking for long periods. We reject multitasking as a harmful and counterproductive time management hack. We reject “busyness” culture and by-the-minute accounting and overscheduling. We curate our environment to reduce distractions and irritants that hinder access to a flow state.

We value systems and habits over specific goals and deliverables. Put in the time and trust the process. The results will appear.
