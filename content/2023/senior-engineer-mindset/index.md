From the folks behind the international Senior Engineer Mindset workshop and bestselling <a href="https://seniormindset.com" target="_blank">Senior Engineer Mindset book</a> comes the Senior Mindset Retreat &mdash; a week in nature to focus on your career with a small group of peers.

## A week in nature to focus on your career

**Picture this:**

You’re in a renovated historic mansion. The sun is shining, birds are singing. Nearby there’s a lake.

You walk down to the kitchen where a delicious home-cooked breakfast awaits. Everyone sitting around the table chatting. Relaxed. You’re engineers with plenty to talk about. The energy is palpable. Good vibes.

After breakfast you sit on the couch for a workshop focused on career growth and the mindset of a senior engineer. No laptops, just friendly conversation and thought-provoking ideas.

In the afternoon, you have time to process. Relax with your thoughts. Maybe go hiking, canoeing on the lake, or just enjoy the summer weather in upstate New York.

For dinner, more delicious food and deep conversation before you relax into bed in your private room.

Sounds nice eh? I would ****love**** that. My best ideas for career growth always come from a week of zero obligation and lots of unstructured time.

And that’s what the **Senior Mindset Retreat** is all about.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just finished “Senior Engineer Mindset” book by <a href="https://twitter.com/Swizec?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Swizec</a>.

![i was in a job interview today that went well](interview.jpg)

> i was excited for this workshop! It reinforced several points but the main point i learned was the path to seniority lies more in teamwork than technical skill. The comfortability and closeness allowed us all to participate, unlike what you may find in a conference presentation. It's great to align yourself with the views of peers and those with experience &mdash; Brandon

> I had no hesitation joining this workshop. It taught me to put more emphasis on selling yourself publicly. Swizec created a comfortable environment for discussions and shared relatable examples that reinforced some of my existing thoughts / practices. The workshop gives a good insight on how to think about development outside of the technical things. &mdash; Greg

> I thought that it was going to be very technical, and I am not yet a senior so I was nervous. But we learned about ownership and impact, how to be a leader, that technical skills matter less than I think and I enjoyed the open forum with great visual examples. The workshop gave me more confidence in my path toward a senior role. It encouraged me to utilize my personal strengths in a way to help the team, lead, and deliver value &mdash; Sydney
