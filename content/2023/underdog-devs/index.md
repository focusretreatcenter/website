## Learning Together and Recharging

This retreat is for the Underdog Devs community to have an opportunity to spend some time learning together in person and to recharge and re-energize. You will continue your self-directed study for the bulk of your day, but you'll have a chance to pair in person, help each other with challenges and questions, maybe give a short talk about something you learned recently or a new tool you picked up.

And you'll get a chance to recharge, rest, and recover. Teaching yourself software development is a huge challenge. Especially when piled on top of your normal obligations and responsibilities. Our hope is this retreat gives everyone a chance for some relaxation and self-care.
