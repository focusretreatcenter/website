It's going to be super fun! You'll get to learn in an immersive setting - to improve your materials and presentation without rushing. You'll meet other trainers who are motivated to do truly outstanding work. You'll visit a lovely wilderness area, make new friends, and enjoy a restorative retreat.

## What are the dates?

We are planning for a 1-week retreat April 2023, but exact dates are not yet finalized. This retreat is being planned in a phased approach. We will gauge interest with email first, then a small refundable deposit, then proceeding with full ticket sales.

* ➡**Phase 1**: Initial Outreach and Interest Gathering
  * We are in this phase currently, January 2023
  * Chelsea and FRC will promote the retreat, answer questions, and gather feedback
  * As the number of interested people crosses a threshold, we'll move to Phase 2
  * Folks can indicate interest with an email and there's no commitment associated with this.
* **Phase 2**: Reservations
  * Once we have a critical mass of interested people, we can…
    * Finalize the proposed dates
    * Start accepting reservations. This will be in the form of a refundable deposit.
    * The retreat is still tentative in this phase. Deposits will be fully refunded if the retreat does not happen. Do not book travel yet in this phase.
* **Phase 3**: Book the retreat
  * As sufficient ticket reservation deposits are made, the retreat will be formally booked.
  * Reservations will be able to be confirmed to full event tickets by paying the remaining ticket price balance.
  * General ticket sales will open for any seats still available.
  * Book travel. [Details on travel to FRC are here.](/travel)

## How much does it cost?

Pricing is not yet finalized but we aim to ensure the retreat is financially accessible to as many guests as possible while also being sustainable for FRC to operate. We are generally able to keep our costs for combined food and lodging below what a typical hotel or airbnb stay would cost for lodging alone. If your employer will count the retreat as Professional Development and cover costs or count it as a work trip to save your PTO, that's great!


## OK I'm interested. Now what?

* Email **team@focusretreatcenter.com** to let us know you are possibly interested in this retreat
  * There is no commitment associated with this. OK if you are just curious.
* We'll announce as the event progresses to the next phase
