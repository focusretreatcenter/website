## What is it?

This is a retreat for authors working on zines, cartoons, infographics, videos, animations, and other **creative documentation of technical subject matter**. It's a week to gather in person, learn from each other, and let fun collaborations and cross-pollinations bloom.

## Why should I participate?

It's going to be super fun! You'll get to work on your projects, collaborate with brilliant creative people working on similar projects, visit a lovely wilderness area, make new friends, and enjoy a restorative retreat.
