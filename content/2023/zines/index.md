+++

## What is it?

This is a retreat for authors working on zines, cartoons, videos, animations, and other **creative documentation of technical subject matter**. It's a week to gather in person, learn from each other, and let fun collaborations and cross-pollinations bloom.

## Why should I participate?

It's going to be super fun! You'll get to work on your projects, collaborate with brilliant creative people working on similar projects, visit a lovely wilderness area, make new friends, and enjoy a restorative retreat.

## What are the dates?

The dates are still to be determined. This retreat is being planned in a phased approach, with people first and dates last:

* ➡**Phase 1**: Initial Outreach and Interest Gathering
  * We are in this phase currently, January 2023
  * An initial set of people have been contacted and are reaching out to their networks for others who might also be interested.
* **Phase 2**: Refine and Plan
  * Once we have a critical mass of interested people, we can…
    * Refine the details of the retreat itself. This is **your** retreat.
    * Do the calendar calculus spreadsheet to find the most workable date
  * This will happen mostly over slack and email
* **Phase 3**: Book the retreat
  * Confirm final dates, book FRC for this event
  * Purchase tickets
  * Book travel. [Details on travel to FRC are here.](/travel)

## How much does it cost?

Pricing is not yet finalized but we aim to ensure the retreat is financially accessible to as many guests as possible while also being sustainable for FRC to operate. We are generally able to keep our costs for combined food and lodging below what a typical hotel or airbnb stay would cost for lodging alone. If your employer will count the retreat as Professional Development and cover costs or count it as a work trip to save your PTO, that's great!


## OK I'm interested. Now what?

* Email **team@focusretreatcenter.com** to let us know you are possibly interested
  * There is no commitment associated with this. OK if you are just curious.
* We'll send you an invite to slack where there's a channel about this retreat
* You'll work with the group to refine the retreat experience and plans
* We'll announce as the event progresses to the next phase
