We are a cozy and pleasant retreat center facility in the heart of downtown Malone Village. It's a short walk to Alice Hyde Medical Center. There are plenty of essential amenities nearby like a Kinney Pharmacy, Stewart's, Grocery stores, Walmart, etc. We are close to Adirondack Park with lots of hiking, boating, and other nature exploring to do. You will have a private bedroom and shared 3/4 bathroom. There's a commercial kitchen and large dining room. We will help you get familiar with the kitchen as the commercial equipment is a bit different from typical residential kitchens. Some meals may be provided by our staff chef Christella but we will discuss the particular details with each guest to see what makes the most sense.

We sometimes have small group retreats come through, but our schedule is quite sparse.
