There has been a series of large layoffs in tech recently: Meta, Twitter, Stripe, Lyft, Shopify, NetFlix, Snap, and many others. There are also larger trends and a confluence of challenging and stressful circumstances that have contributed to burnout and have also peaked in the past few years:

* pandemic, quarantine, and isolation
* disillusionment with big tech overall
* too much time working from home plus staying home to limit pandemic exposure
* War
* Politics
* Relentlessly negative news and media

If you were laid off from your tech job, we're sorry you have to experience that and wish you the best in responding to that unexpected change. Job changes and feelings of burnout are circumstances we feel can often benefit from taking a retreat to process, heal, and re-energize. We think working on one's own creative work without external pressures and deadlines can be a cure for burnout. One of our driving motivators here is seeing creative people flourish and do their best work.
