In August we had generative artists, game developers, VR developers, data scientists, and programmers here working on their projects. This retreat was 3 weeks during the peak of the summer season.

They worked on their games and projects, collaborated with each other, and enjoyed some time to rest and reset after a stressful year.

This game is written in a custom LISP programming language and compiles through Haxe to several target languages and platforms. It’s a habit tracker that fosters healthy habits with gamification by rewarding completed tasks with a new piece of the puzzle to solve.
