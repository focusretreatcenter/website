We are pleased to announce the dates for our inaugural Programming Retreat this year:

### August 1 through 21

Guests will travel to Malone on Monday August 1. We'll have a 3-week retreat experience, and depart on Sunday August 21.

This retreat we will have a great mix of programmers, generative artists, community builders, and game developers. We have already seen lots of excitement in our applications:

> "I haven’t even finished reading the website and all details but I am ridiculously excited and think I might be a great fit."

----

>  "I'm hoping to focus on the project long enough that I can make it to a Kickstarter before the end of the year."
----

> "it’s 1000% what I need in my life right now."

Please help us spread the word and send anyone who wants to learn more about what a programming retreat is all about to email **team@focusretreatcenter.com** or [contact us through this form](https://focusretreatcenter.com/contact).
