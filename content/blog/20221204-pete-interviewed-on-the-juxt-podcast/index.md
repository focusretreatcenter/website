In September, Pete attended the [Strange Loop](https://thestrangeloop.com/) Tech Conference held in St. Louis. One of the sponsoring tech companies, [JUXT](https://www.juxt.pro/) had a booth and conducted a series of short interviews/chats with attendees for their podcast, the JUXT Cast. JUXT is a consultancy bringing great people and innovative technologies together. They do a lot of clojure, have a super cool bitemporal database product called XTBD, and have been longtime participants and sponsors with Strange Loop.

In this short 13-minute chat, Pete takes Renzo through the motivation and backstory for Focus Retreat Center, what types of groups we had in our first season, and what a typical experience at FRC is like.
