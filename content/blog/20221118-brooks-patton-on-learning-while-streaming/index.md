I had the opportunity to have a great chat with Brooks Patton who has been live streaming coding sessions since 2016. Brooks streams 6 mornings a week and has worked on the coding game Screeps Arena in rust, his "Brooks Builds" series of courses, and lots of other interesting projects. Brooks is a software engineering manager, coding course author, and community leader. Here's the video of our discussion.
