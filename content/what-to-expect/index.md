This page outlines the essential details of our facilities and daily life on retreat. Prior to their arrival, retreat guests are also sent the FRC Handbook which has even more detail. Email us at info@focusretreatcenter.com if you have any questions!

## Retreat Groups

Retreats range in size from 4 to 14 guests. Most retreats are 1 week in length. We also may have guests doing longer term residencies at FRC as well and they generally mingle in with the retreat groups seamlessly.

* full-sized bed

* sit-stand ergonomic desk & office chair

## Common Rooms

There are 2 larger common rooms where guests are encouraged to work in a collaborative atmosphere. Each guest's desk and chair are on wheels so they are easy to move back and forth between the common rooms and bedrooms at will. There are some larger tables for working together as well.

### Media Room

There is a media room with smart TV and home theater speakers for watching movies and listening to music in small groups.

### Hobby Rooms

Spare rooms can be set up for hobbies like music, sewing, crafting, etc as fits the interests of each group.

## Shared Bathrooms

The main building has 6 total guest bathrooms that are shared. 4 are off the common rooms, and 2 are semi-private situated between 2 bedrooms. There's plenty of hot water and with so many bathrooms available it's unlikely that you will ever need to wait to use one.

## Meals

Meals are served in our dining room which can seat an entire retreat group at the same time. The dinner menu is chef-chosen,  prepared for the group, and served buffet style. Lunch is typically based around sandwiches, soups, and salads. Breakfast is either cooked-to-order diner fare: eggs, pancakes, etc or continental style: oatmeal, cereal, yogurt, fruit, etc.

Self-serve coffee, tea, snacks and leftovers are available to guests at all times. Bread, cookies, and assorted delicious pastries are baked fresh almost every day. There is a large refrigerator named "Chilly McChillface" in the dining room where guests can keep a small amount of supplemental personal food items. There's a few appliances available for continental style use by guests for snacks outside of mealtime including a microwave, toaster, and egg cookers.

### Dietary Restrictions

FRC's main menu is omnivorous and varied, emphasizing fresh seasonal ingredients available locally. We can accommodate vegetarian and vegan diets as well as most food allergies. When booking a retreat, there's a section where you can specify your dietary needs and we will work closely with you to ensure you are well nourished and cared for.

## Internet and WiFi

FRC has blazing fast (900+Mbps) Internet and WiFi6 access points throughout the property. Wireless internet is reliable and fast in every room of the building. If you prefer wired, there is also wired ethernet in all bedrooms and common rooms as another option. 

## Laundry

There is a laundry facility on site with free washing machines, driers, and unscented detergent. Guests may wash their own clothes as needed. Bed linens and bath towels can be exchanged for fresh clean items as needed. We encourage guests to use towels and linens for a week before exchanging for laundry.

## Parking

FRC has private off-street parking available on our property. There's additional parking available as needed in the church parking lot next door as well. Of course guests are encouraged to carpool as much as possible in transit to FRC.

## Porch and Yard

There's a sun porch adjacent to the dining room available for chatting over coffee, working, etc. We have adirondack chairs, a hammock, blankets, etc for use in the back yard. There's also a fire pit that's lovely to sit around in the evenings.

## The Village of Malone

FRC is located in the heart of the Village of Malone, NY. All of your basic needs are easy to meet nearby including pharmacies, convenience stores, grocery stores, liquor stores, Walmart, hiking outfitters, etc. We are in a historic district that is lovely to walk around the residential streets, or head over to the Recreation Park for nature trails. Most cellular providers have plenty of signal in the village. Directly in front of FRC is a small lovely park called Arsenal Green full of mature trees and benches with plenty of good squirrel watching.

## Daily Schedule

Details of each retreat will vary, but we lean toward self-directed activities. So each guest will have a lot of autonomy around how they spend their time at FRC. Meal times set the main rhythm. There's typically a daily check-in just after breakfast. We prefer for the entire group to eat dinner together.

## Hiking and Nature

We are located just at the northern edge of Adirondack Park. It's the largest system of hiking trails in the nation with over 2000 miles of trail. There are thousands upon thousands of lakes, rivers, and streams among 6 million acres of forest land. It is very large and very beautiful. Retreat guests are encouraged to explore and to self-organize and carpool for excursions into the park. The towns of Lake Placid, Saranac Lake, and Tupper Lake all have interesting things to see and do as well.
